This program checks if your Python code only uses certain constructs,
which you can configure.

Like all static analysis tools, `allowed` isn't perfect and will never be.
There will be false positives (code reported to be a violation, but isn't)
and false negatives (code that uses disallowed constructs but isn't reported).

This program requires Python 3.10 or later and that your code compiles.

If you use `allowed` in your course, we'd love to hear about your experience in the
[show & tell forum](https://github.com/dsa-ou/allowed/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).

## Installation

Click on the green 'Code' button and select the 'download zip' option.
Unzip the downloaded file if your web browser hasn't done so.
This creates an `allowed-main` folder within your downloads folder.

The only files you need within that folder are `allowed.py` and `m269.json`,
which you may move to anywhere, e.g. to the folder with the code you want to check.
The example files with code to check (`sample.py`, `sample.ipynb` and `magics.ipynb`)
can be removed after going through the following explanations.

## Usage

Open a terminal. Change to the folder where you have put `allowed.py`.
You can check code files and Jupyter notebook files by typing
```bash
python allowed.py path/to/file.py path/to/notebook.ipynb ...
```
This will list all disallowed constructs in the given files.
If a Python file has a syntax error, it can't be parsed and hence it's not checked.

For example, you can check the sample file and `allowed`'s code with:
```bash
python allowed.py sample.py allowed.py
```
or with
```bash
python allowed.py sample.ipynb allowed.py
```
If you expect a long list of disallowed constructs, it may be better to
check one file at a time and store the report in a text file, e.g.
```bash
python allowed.py allowed.py > disallowed.txt
```
To check all `.py` and `.ipynb` files in a folder and its subfolders, type:
```bash
python allowed.py path/to/folder
```

### Extra checks

To check if the attribute access `variable.method` is allowed,
the program needs to know the type of `variable`. For that purpose, it uses
the `pytype` type checker, which only works with Python versions 3.7 to 3.10.

For installation instructions, see [its website](https://google.github.io/pytype).
On Windows, you must first install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

By default, `allowed` skips method call checks because they slow down the process.
You can enable these checks with option `-m` or `--methods`, for example
```bash
python allowed.py -m sample.py
```
will print one further violation: method `list.count()` is used in line 52.

The methods call option can appear anywhere after `allowed.py` and in either form.
For example, the following two commands are equivalent:
```bash
python allowed.py -m file1.py file2.py
python allowed.py file1.py --methods file2.py
```

### Organising by units

`allowed` assumes that your course or textbook is organised in 'units'
(lessons, weeks, chapters, whatever you want) and that they are cumulative:
a Python construct introduced in a unit can be used in any subsequent unit.

By default, `allowed` uses all units, i.e. checks against all the material introduced.
Option `-u N` or `--unit N` will check the file(s) against
the Python constructs introduced up to unit `N` (inclusive).
For example, checking a submission to an assessment that covers units 1 to 5
can be done with:
```bash
python allowed.py -u 5 submission.py
```
To see the weekly difference in the allowed constructs, type for example:
```bash
python allowed.py -u 2 sample.py
python allowed.py -u 4 sample.py
```
The second command will report fewer violations because units 3 and 4 of
the default configuration introduce Booleans, lists, strings and tuples.

If the file name starts with the unit number and there's no unit option,
the file is checked against that unit. For example,
```bash
python allowed.py 05_submission.py
```
also checks the submission against the constructs introduced in units 1–5.
However, if the file name starts with a number that isn't the intended unit,
you must provide it,
e.g. if the file name starts with the number of the assignment, not of the unit:
```bash
python allowed.py 01_submission.py -u 5
```
Like the methods call option, the unit option can appear
anywhere after `allowed.py` and in either form.

### Checking notebooks

`allowed` does check Jupyter notebooks and reports the cells and lines with
disallowed constructs. For example, `path/to/notebook.ipynb:cell_13:5: ...`
means that the problem is in line 5 of the 13th code cell.

Any code cells that do not constitute valid Python will report a syntax error
for the corrisponding cell and will not undergo the check. The use of Ipython
magics such as `%timeit` and `%run` will trigger a syntax error in the
absence of an `ipython` installation. Conversely, if `ipython` is installed,
the magics will be deemed valid Python allowing those cells to be checked
(other syntax errors not withstanding), but will only pass the check if 
function calls and attributes are allowed. 

Previous versions of `allowed` recomended
[nbqa](https://http://nbqa.readthedocs.io) for handling Jupyter notebooks. You
can checkout the project on Github [here](https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA).

## Configuration

The program is already configured for our course,
[M269](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/m269),
but you can create your own configuration by creating a JSON file of the form
```json
{
   "FILE_UNIT": "...",
   "LANGUAGE": { ... },
   "IMPORTS": { ... },
   "METHODS": { ... }
}
```
File [`m269.json`](m269.json) is the default configuration.
You can copy, rename and edit it to configure `allowed` for your course.

You can have multiple configuration files and select one with
option `-c` or `--config`, e.g.
```bash
python allowed.py assignment.py -c cs101.json
```

### FILE_UNIT
This entry in the JSON file is
a [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html)
that extracts the unit from the file name.
If there's a match, the unit number must be in the first group of the regular expression.
If there's no match, the unit given with option `-u` will be used.

Note that in JSON you have to double each backspace used in the regular expression.
For example, `"^(\\d+)"` extracts the unit number from the start of the file,
while `"(\\d+).(py|ipynb)$"` extracts it from the end of the file.
If the names of your files don't include a unit number,
remove the `"FILE_UNIT"` entry or set it to the empty string.

### LANGUAGE
This entry is a dictionary that maps each unit number to
a list of strings describing the syntax and built-in functions introduced in that unit. For example,
```json
"LANGUAGE": {
   "2": ["name", "+", "help"]
}
```
means that unit 2 introduces names (identifiers), the plus operator and the builtin `help` function.

For the possible syntactical elements, see dictionary `SYNTAX` in `allowed.py`.
For the possible built-in functions, see set `BUILTINS` in `allowed.py`.

The various uses of a construct can't be individually allowed or disallowed.
For example, you can't allow integer addition
and disallow string concatenation (or vice versa): you either allow
the `+` operator (and all its uses) or you don't.

Adding `"for"` and `"while"` to `"LANGUAGE"` only allows the 'normal' loops.
To also allow the `else` clause in loops, add `"for else"` and `"while else"`.

### IMPORTS
This entry is a dictionary that maps units to dictionaries of
the modules and the list of exported objects introduced in those units. For example,
```json
"IMPORTS": {
   "10": {"math": ["sqrt", "inf"]},
   "11": {"math": ["abs"], "fractions": ["Fraction"]}
}
```
allows function `math.sqrt(x)` and constant `math.inf` from unit 10 onwards, and
allows function `math.abs(x)` and class `fractions.Fraction` from unit 11 on.

Entry `"METHODS"` has the same structure as `"IMPORTS"`, but instead of listing
which objects of which modules can be imported,
it lists which methods of which classes can be called.
