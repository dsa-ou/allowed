This is the initial version, given to the 2022/23 students of M269.
It provides the core functionality:
- check one or more Python files, or all Python files in a subtree
- check against the M269 configuration (included in `allowed.py`)
- check method calls if `pytype` is installed
- check against a unit, given with `-u` or extracted from the file name
- check notebooks, using [`nbqa`](https://nbqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html)
